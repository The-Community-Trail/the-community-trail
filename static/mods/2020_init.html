In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and widespread calls for racial and economic justice, voter turnout is expected to break records. Can Warren unite a broad coalition of progressive activists, anti-Trump voters, and working-class Americans to defeat Trump and enact her bold vision for structural reform? Or will Trump, once again trailing in the polls, defy expectations and pull off another upset, securing a second term despite widespread discontent?</p>",
