A government has finally been formed.</p><p>The queen has appointed Mr. ${leader.leaderName} to form a new cabinet, which is of course a mere formality, given that a majority of the House of Representatives supports it.</p><p>At least it's not purple again, so there's at least some change, but to you this center-left coalition is not that much of an improvement - you cannot expect your type of policies to be passed by this government. The coalition is made up of PvdA, CDA, D66 and GroenLinks. For the latter that's a first, so congratulations to them, you suppose. As for you, you will be in the opposition. The CDA must have been real anxious to avoid you if they agreed to ally with both GroenLinks and D66 to go over the left. Your best shot is to continue growing your movement from this position in the House of Representatives. With some luck this cabinet will collapse in time and you can finally banish the PvdA from government.</p>`]
