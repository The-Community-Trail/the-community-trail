Perhaps there is a compromise to be found where he returns to the CDA? Then it wouldn't be seat theft."}},{"model":"campaign_trail.answer","pk":2008,"fields":{"question":1002,"description":"Purple may have a majority here, but we have pull in Brussels.

It's too late to reverse course without great costs, however."}},{"model":"campaign_trail.answer","pk":2054,"fields":{"question":1013,"description":"The government should have negotiated an exception like our friends across the channel and Denmark.

Especially as terrorism is becoming a larger threat, it would not be right to punish Israel for dealing with security threats."}},{"model":"campaign_trail.answer","pk":2069,"fields":{"question":1017,"description":"Obviously not, the CDA has always been a loyal friend to Israel.
