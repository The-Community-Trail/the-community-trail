The people prepare for the election tomorrow, not as an apocalyptic event or a fight for their lives, but as just another their step in their collective journey through history. They live comfortably knowing that the world won't end on November 5th, it will just change, just as it changed 59 times prior. The Rage that once ruled this country has been subdued, but not vanquished. It will always be there in the background, waiting to take root, but for now it is beaten.</p>\n\n<p>You think about the future. 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040, and all the ones after. You worry for a moment that the Rage might return during any of these future elections. The Rage always seems the strongest during election years. But then you look again at the people around you. They were once consumed by the Rage, but have been brought back to sense, with a little nudging by you. You feel hope, hope that they will beat the Rage when it rears its head once more. Because you know they're stronger than it.</p>\n\n<p>You're tired... You didn't know that you could feel tired...

Looking at their fellow countrymen as an other, as a threat, as an enemy.</p>\n\n<p>You wonder how they can stand to live like this, with anger and hate flowing out of every orifice, but the longer you think about it the more it makes sense. Rage is a primal emotion, one of the most basic ones people can have. It's one of the easiest to bring out, yet also the hardest to control. To control rage is an effort not everyone will take, especially if that rage is \"justified\". Why go through that effort? Rage is natural. Rage is simple. Rage... is easy... You can hear the most radical of the voices infesting this land. You hear murmurs of protest, riot, insurrection, and even a Second Civil War. No matter who wins tomorrow's election, the rage will grow. And it will grow with the one after that, and the one after that, and the one after that... It will build and build until it tips over the edge, and the carnage begins...</p>\n\n<p>You look around in horror and realize that you stand in a land full of people ready to tear each other apart, supposedly, out of their love for you. You can't stay and watch. You won't. It's time to go back to sleep.</p>\n\n<p>On Election Day, every American receives a message from an unknown number. \"Goodbye everyone.

Will your worst nightmares come to pass, despite everything you did to try and stop them? For a moment you think about staying here, perpetually keeping the Rage at bay, but you know you can't. It wouldn't be right. Whatever this country's future is, it lies in the hands of its people, and you need to trust them to take good care of it.</p>\n\n<p>You're tired...
