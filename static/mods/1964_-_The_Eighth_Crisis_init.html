My playtesters were also all fantastic-so neo, TedThing, and Gardfeld, Ettingermentum, Mango (who also helped pick the images), and those others who tested, you all really helped make this mod shine. Ted also helped make the wonderful themes, and they really are fantastic, so I'd want to thank him too.
