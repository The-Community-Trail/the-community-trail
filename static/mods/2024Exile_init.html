	{searchString: "Russian", explanationText: "The Russian Democratic Federal Republic is the largest country in the world and fastest growing major economy in Europe. The Socialist Revolutionaries and Kadets have governed Russia – either in a grand coalition or in alternative alliances with smaller parties like the Eurasianists and Homeland – since the republic was founded."},
    {searchString: "Appalachian Wars", explanationText: "A series of post USSA conflicts fought between the rump FR America and the secessionist Confederal States and Black Belt."},
	{searchString: "Exile Establishment", explanationText: "The \"Exiles\" are the Anglophone descendants of MacArthur’s loyalists, who fled to Puerto Rico during the Great Retreat. They have a preponderant economic power and dominate the PB."},
	{searchString: "Dissident Mormons", explanationText: "Mormons not affiliated with the LDS Church, for various reasons of conscience or doctrine. Especially vocal dissenters can expect to live in permanent fear of the Church’s hatchet men. The most famous example is Prime Minister Romney of New England."},
	{searchString: "Deseret", explanationText: "The theodemocratic State of Deseret was established by militant Mormons following the collapse of the USSA. It comprises the former US state of Utah and neighbouring territories. Its bellicose conduct and possession of fissile material has been a matter of international concern for years."},
	{searchString: "Federal Bureau of Investigation", explanationText: "Originally founded as a law enforcement agency, the FBI would grow into a secret police during the civil war. Under the fearsome leadership of J. Edgar Hoover, the Bureau coordinated both the White Terror and extraction of personnel and resources to Puerto Rico. <br><br>After the Great Retreat, the Bureau implemented a program of full spectrum surveillance in the remaining territories and brutally suppressed dissent. Hoover’s death early in the Boggs presidency was a crucial step to democratization and led to substantial reforms, but the FBI is still viewed with apprehension, even by many exiles."},
	{searchString: "John McCain", explanationText: "The first and only PB president since Carter, John McCain was a buffoon twice carried to victory by an effective but disloyal team. His disastrous relationships with successive German chancellors and contemptuous attitude towards the post-USSA states were only mitigated by damage control from far more competent VPs and the heroic efforts of the State Department. <br><br>Well intentioned efforts to open the PB to new voters represent the major achievement of his presidency and were crucial to his re-election in spite of all his flaws."},
	{searchString: "Alejandro García Padilla", explanationText: "As John McCain’s last Attorney General, he distinguished himself as a competent lawyer with a passion for consumer rights. Judging that his Puerto Rican ethnicity and youth would appeal to the younger generation, the party chose Padilla as their candidate against Gloria Tristani, first out of choice, then for lack of better options. <br><br>While he benefited from McCain’s outreach to non-traditional PB voters, his emphasis on fiscal stability and accusations of nepotism severely dented his campaign. On both occasions, Padilla proved competitive in the countryside, but NP attacks characterising him as a \"jíbaro\" with bad English meant he fared poorly with the urban middle class."},
	{searchString: "British", explanationText: "The only major socialist state in Europe, the Union of Britain has been ruled by the Maximist Union Party since Oswald Mosley’s consolidation of power in 1938. For the next 40 years, the Union and its Norwegian client state were largely pariahs, with an abiding hostility towards the USSA. <br><br>With Mosley’s death in 1978, Tony Benn undertook substantial reforms which moved the UoB towards a market economy without political liberalisation, drastically improving quality of life and mollifying some of the Union’s most hostile neighbours. <br><br>Under the incumbent Chairman, Graeme Andrew Logan, the Union has begun to adopt a more aggressive posture, especially towards its traditional enemies in Canada."},
	{searchString: "Mexicans", explanationText: "The United Mexican States in its present form is defined by Plutarco Elías Calles and Lázaro Cárdenas. Though Calles was successful in revising many of the unequal treaties with the United States, his harsh anticlericalism was deeply unpopular and led Mexico into the devastating Cristero War. <br><br>The inability of the United States to impose peace terms and gradual intervention of socialist forces on behalf of the Mexican government crystalized a broad Catholic volunteer movement, headed by the Carlists. The war only concluded with the ouster of Calles by the armed forces in favour of Cárdenas. <br><br>Reforming the Calles Law and imitating European clerical socialism, Cárdenas proceeded to successfully bring a subordinate church into the fold. Together with his combination of land reform and corporatist economics, he thus established the alliance of state, church and army which has governed Mexico into the current day."},
	{searchString: "a jíbaro", explanationText: "Often maligned as a hillbilly, the jíbaro is an independent smallholder, especially common in the mountains. Though poor and just scrimping by, he is a proud and prudent Catholic. A stock character in Carlist political propaganda."},
	{searchString: "Separatist Republics", explanationText: "<img src='https://i.imgur.com/mycam5F.png' style='max-width: 800px; max-height: 800px;'> The various states that emerged following the breakup of the USSA. Ranging from the dystopic to fairly pluralistic democracies, each republic defines itself by an identity opposed to those of their neighbours."},
	{searchString: "Pacto del Olvido", explanationText: "The so-called Pact of Forgetting was an informal agreement reached between the two parties following democratization. The pact aimed to ensure a smooth transition to democracy by not overturning the cultural trappings of the dictatorship in full and offering amnesty to the security state and military. Key aspects include a prohibition on mass-removal of MacArthur statues, celebration of the 4th of July & \"Armed Forces Day\" and continued payment of veterans’ pensions. <br><br>The Pact is increasingly controversial with the younger generation and has gradually been eroded by the passage of various \"historical memory\" laws."},
	{searchString: "claims of potential crimes", explanationText: "Under martial law, the PB dictatorship carried out a brutal campaign of political repression against independentist and socialists, aimed at stamping out a potential USSA \"fifth column\". Infamous examples of this brutality are the Jayuya massacre and the repression of opponents to chemical weapons testing on Isla de Vieques. <br><br>Notable perpetrators of regime atrocities were the famously loyalist Afro-American \"Buffalo Soldiers\" of the 24th & 25th Infantry Regiments and the notorious FBI \"Mobile Division\". The activities of the former represent a regular flashpoint in race relations on Puerto Rico."},
	{searchString: "minority voters", explanationText: "Black and indigenous voters have traditionally been the PB’s \"iron voters\", reliably turning out for the party with supermajorities into the 2010s. While this trend has diminished in more recent elections, this loyalty is attributable to above-average enlistment in the Armed Forces, strong political machines at the local level and the NPP’s complicated relationship with people of African descent."},
	{searchString: "Colombia", explanationText: "For the last 70 years, political life in the Republic of Colombia has been dominated by the figure of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. After seizing power in a military coup, Rojas established a left-wing populist program inspired by developments in such countries as Mexico and China. While extremely popular with peasant smallholders and the urban poor, \"Rojismo\" disturbed the traditional elites and conservatives, who gradually took up arms against Rojas. These right-wing militias were subsequently joined by Bolivian and USSA funded partisans, seeking to establish a socialist state. Both groups funded their activities through intimidation, drug production and outright banditry. <br><br>As the conflict dragged on and it became increasingly that the government would not be toppled, rebel forces gradually began to turn drugs production from a source of income to their primary activity, giving rise to narco-militias and outright cartels. Colombia has now spent the better part of a half-century plagued by civil violence and drug crime, with a political system characterized by the \"popular tutelage\" of the National Popular Alliance."},
	{searchString: "Mitteleuropa", explanationText: "<img src='https://i.imgur.com/nxZT7h8.png' style='max-width: 800px; max-height: 800px;'> The Old Continent’s economic and political union represents the dream of 100 years of Pan-Europeanist ideals. While German hegemony ensures their leading position in the bloc, careful work by the other Member States allows for counterbalancing action that prevents their total domination of the organisation."},
	{searchString: "EPA", explanationText: "Established during democratization by Jimmy Carter, the Environmental Protection Agency has two roles. <br><br>On one hand, it struggles to protect Puerto Rico’s natural beauty from reckless development, environmentally destructive practices and waste dumping. <br><br>On the other, it works in tandem with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Decontamination to heal the scars left by the dictatorship’s biological and chemical weapons program, returning toxic areas to human habitation. This is best seen on the island of Vieques, where decades of testing require close-cooperation with the Armed Forces to begin clean-up and the task is projected to last until the mid-21st century."},
	{searchString: "USSA", explanationText: "From the early 40s to its collapse in the 90s, the United Socialist States of America never fully renounced the idea of crushing \"the Caribbean entity\". While this always took a backseat to conflicts on the mainland and with Canada, fear of invasion prompted San Juan’s experiments with a biological-chemical deterrence system and a serious deterrence effort by the Kaiserliche Marine. <br><br>Repeated attempts to land saboteurs and agents on the island only stoked the fires of the White Terror and tended to coincide with the worst massacres and atrocities of the Martial Law period."},
	{searchString: "Jimmy Carter", explanationText: "The first civilian president of the United States since ill-fated John Nance Garner was overthrown on Christmas Day 1940. A veteran of the Civil War, he continued President Boggs’ efforts to constrain the power of the FBI-led security state & made common cause with George H. W. Bush’s attempts to modernize the Bureau. This culminated in the end of Martial Law and the legalization of opposition parties, ahead of the 1988 elections. <br><br>When Baltasar Corrada del Río won, Carter made sure to assist him in preparing to take power and presided over the first peaceful transition of the presidency in 50 years. In addition, Carter’s moving away from the autarkic economy that had characterized the dictatorship laid the groundwork for the economic boom of the 1990s that made Puerto Rico one of the \"Jaguar Economies\". <br><br>Well regarded by all but the most radical, Carter’s death in 2020 was marked by a week of national mourning and condolences from from around the world."},
	{searchString: "Martin O’Malley", explanationText: "The notorious former strongman of Mid-Atlantic, who dominated the politics of the post-USSA state for almost 30 years, establishing a hybrid regime dominated by powerful oligarchs. Ousted by an anti-corruption movement allied to FR American revivalists, he is currently in exile in Ireland, fending off attempts to extradite him to Philadelphia for a probable show trial. <br><br>Rumoured to be attempting to return to power by taking advantage of the current instability in Mid-Atlantic, O’Malley should not be ruled as a important figure in the politics of the Eastern Seaboard."},
	{searchString: "Charlie Crist", explanationText: "The first CS president from \"the Browder Generation\", elected on a platform of modernizing services and reforming the relationship between the states and the central government in Richmond.<br><br>An active campaigner with good political instincts, which proved critical when he became enmeshed in controversy over his record in the Young Pioneers and his refusal to invite former president Taylor to his inauguration."},
	{searchString: "PEA", explanationText: "<img src='https://i.imgur.com/R7TLS5q.png' style='max-width: 800px; max-height: 800px;'> The sucessor organisation to the GEACPS, the Pacific Economic Area corresponds to Japan’s economic and political sphere. While the other member states have grown increasingly autonomous within the organisation in the last decades, the size and scope of the Japanese economy marks it out as a clear leader in the organisation.<br><br>By abolishing customs barriers and coordinating trade practices, the organisation aims to create a single market area across the Pacific Rim, a reality complicated by the region’s inter-bloc competition. Headquartered in Tokyo and with Japanese, English and Spanish as working languages and translation services for several more."}
