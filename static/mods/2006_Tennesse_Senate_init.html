He was first elected back in 1996 to succeed his father. His family has been involved in Tennessee politics for a while though his family has tended to be involved in many dramas. Besides that, Ford was the keynote speaker at the DNC in 2000. He challenged Nancy Pelosi to become the the new House Democratic Leader. He failed to beat her but did better than expected. Besides that and during his time as a congressman, Ford has largely been in line with democratic party as he voted for more gun restrictions, supported unions, and more drug rehabilitation reform though is somewhat pro-life. Ford is considered by himself and others to be fairly moderate on a lot of things and is a member of the blue dogs which are moderate to conservative democrats.<br><br>Ford is now running for the class 1 senate after the retirement of Bill Frist. He faced no serious opposition in the primaries and won easiy. However, Ford will have to overcome a deepening red state which voted republican in the last 2 elections even with Tennessean democrat on the ticket. He also has less money from fundraising compared to Corker and has his base in the less populous Western Tennessee. Though it is not gloomy for Ford as he can easily attack Corker on the unpopular adminstration and is assisted by the 6 year itch.<br><br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>",

The democrats are now more estatic than they were before. They now have 50 seats in the senate plus newly elected Bernie Sanders who caucuses with democrats. Corker gives you his concessions despondent at failing to keep this seat republican.You are the first democrat elected to the senate from Tennessee since Al Gore.\n<br><br> After being sworn into office, your name recognition grows as many were stunned at your victory. You along with other democrats water down anything Bush wanted. Bush was forced to compromise on a lot of things much to the chagrin of your party. You consider running in the 2008 election but decide not to with your good friend, Barack Obama, winning the nomination. You helped campaign for him as he did for you namely in the south. As Obama won the election, you were one of his key allies in the senate. When Obamacare was being prepared, your vote was critical as Lieberman opted out due to the public option provision. You said yay and history was made. \n<br>As 2012 rolled around, you faced concerning polling, but,thankfully, because of your continued campaign for Obama, your popularity, and his coattails, you held by a fairly comfortable margin of 5 points. \n<br> 2018 was a whole other story, polling showed a toss up between you and your opponent. You campaigned harder than any time in your career.Your vote during the Kavanaugh confirmation was critical in shooting down some of the republican enthusiasm. It helped you barely hold on. You decide to run for president in 2020 and shockingly did very well thanks to your ethnic background and Obama endorsing you. You ended up winning the nomination and the election. With your party having retaken the senate rather comfortably, you were able get a lot of your agenda passed and cruised to reelection. After the presidency, you retired from politics while still endorsing various democrats in your state and nationally.",

You spend your days in the business sector while also being a frequent poltical commentator on Fox News and spending time with your new family. <br><br>As for that senate seat,  Corker would be easily reelected in 2012. He then ultimately retired in 2018. The seat was opened between republic Marsha Blackburn and democrat Phil Bredesen. It looked competitive for a while but the Kavanaugh hearing comepletely screwed over him allowing Blackburn to win easily. Blackburn would easily win reelection as well.",
