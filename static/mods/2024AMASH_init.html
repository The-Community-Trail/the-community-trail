Amash decided to rejoin the GOP to run against Mike Rogers and many other candidates in the Republican primary. Knowing that none of these candidates would even dare to try and save libertarian values, he entered the race.  </p>\n\n<p>Many priorities for voters exist in  the election, such as the Gaza war, the economy, the competency of Joe Biden, Donald Trump's convictions, inflation, and the Ukraine war. Amash and the other candidates have to thread the needle carefully to support the issues that their base wants without turning off other voters. </p>",

He is the second of three sons born to Arab Christian parents who had immigrated to the United States. His father, Attallah Amash, is a Palestinian Christian whose family lived in Ramla until they were forcibly expelled by Israeli soldiers during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Amash’s mother, Mimi, is a Syrian Christian. After high school, he studied economics at the University of Michigan, graduated from the University of Michigan Law School, and briefly worked as a corporate lawyer and consultant before entering politics.</p>\n\n<p>Amash represented Michigan’s 3rd congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2011 to 2021. Originally a Republican, Amash left the GOP and became an independent on July 4, 2019. In April 2020, he joined the Libertarian Party, leaving Congress in January 2021 as the only Libertarian to serve in Congress. He was the founder and chairperson of the Liberty Caucus and was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus. Amash received national attention when he became the first Republican congressman to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump. He did not seek reelection to Congress in 2020. On February 29, 2024, Amash announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in Michigan, his goal being to win and extend personal freedoms for all Michiganders, end the Gaza war, and defeat MAGA MIKE!.</p>",

You grab the mic and say \"Hello my friends, tonight has been a great night for Michigan and liberty as a whole. But remember, I couldn't be here without you guys, the voters. You are the reason this happened. I also want to thank the staff, the volunteers, and the petitioners that made this campaign happen. You guys are the backbone of my campaign.

You begin to tear up, as your wife Kara comes to console you. You know you have to address the crowd, so you wipe the tears, put on a fake smile, and go out there. \"Hello everyone, thanks for being here tonight. I congratulate Mike Rogers for winning today, and he put up a great challenge. I also would like to thank you guys, the volunteers and the voters.\" You keep talking about the issues and thanking people, before leaving the stage and feeling a unique feeling.
