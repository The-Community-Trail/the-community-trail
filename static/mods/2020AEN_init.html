Soon the primary  was down to two canidates, Bernie and Pete, the South Bend Mayor eventually won as Sanders suspended his campaign. But buckle up you'll still have to navigate a relatively hostile electorate, Trump's already started calling you nicknames, but maybe you can do it, maybe you can become the country's first openly gay president!
