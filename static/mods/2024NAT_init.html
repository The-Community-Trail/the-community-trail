Known for his curious nature, his famed misdeeds, his naughty activities and his refusal to disavow them, Rambo has become a legend in the eyes of Naturians. More than that, he is an agent of reaction against radical changes to Naturia proposed by the evil axis of Together, the Revolutionary Front and their minor ally, Rodentia. As the sole candidate of the right-wing Paws of Change Party, with a strong message of fighting for a more isolationist and conservative direction for the nation, Rambo will have to prove that his message of unity, strength, activity, and continuing the values that make Naturia great can resonate with voters. And of course, he'll have to make sure not to betray his own principles, those of fighting against the introduction of new guests, visitors, or animals, into Naturia.
